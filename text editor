Today, people and organizations of all walks of life manage blogs to share analyses, instruction, criticisms, 
and other observations of an industry in which they are a rising expert.
With all this blogging how-to, literally anyone can blog as long as they truly know the subject matter they’re writing about.
And since you’re an expert in your industry, there’s no longer any reason you can’t sit down every day and hammer 
out an excellent blog post.
Please make sure that when you use the text editor that comes on your computer, that you’re creating code in a plain text editor. 
You should not see options for making text bold, underlined, or italic. Plain text has no formatting options.
There is no need to bold, underline or italicize code. If you can make your text bold, underlined or italic,
then you might need to change a setting somewhere. Please make sure you’re coding in plain text.
