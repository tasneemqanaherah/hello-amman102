Variables

Most of the time, a JavaScript application needs to work with information. Here are two examples:
An online shop – the information might include goods being sold and a shopping cart.
A chat application – the information might include users, messages, and much more.
Variables are used to store this information.

To create a variable in JavaScript, use the let keyword.
